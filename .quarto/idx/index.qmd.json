How has this increase in global ambition shifted the pace of change in the energy system? And what impact will this have on the fuel mix and emissions?\n\n![](figures/ee2.png){fig-align=\"center\" width=\"508\"}\n\nEnergy economics is a broad scientific subject area which includes topics related to supply and use of energy in societies. Due to diversity of issues and methods applied and shared with a number of academic disciplines, energy economics does not present itself as a self contained academic discipline, but it is an applied sub-discipline of economics. From the list of main topics of economics, some relate strongly to energy economics:\n\n-   Econometrics\n-   Environmental economics\n-   Industrial ecology\n-   Microeconomics\n-   Macroeconomics\n-   Resource economics\n\nEnergy economics also draws heavily on results of energy engineering, geology, political sciences, ecology etc. Recent focus of energy economics includes the following issues:\n\n-   Climate change and climate policy\n-   Sustainability\n-   Energy and economic growth\n-   Economics of energy infrastructure\n-   Environmental policy\n-   Energy policy\n-   Elasticity of supply and demand in energy market\n\nLecture contents:\n\n**Section 1: Energy Economics**\n\n- Lecture 1: Course Introduction & Energy Overview\n\n- Lecture 2: Energy: An Economistâ€™s View\n\n- Lecture 3: Energy Markets, Prices, and Efficiency\n\n- Lecture 4: The Economics of Renewable Energy\n\n- Lecture 5: Energy and Economic Growth\n\n- Lecture 6: Economic Theory of the Mine\n\n**Section 2: Environmental and Natural Resource Economics**\n\n- Lecture 7:  Oil and Natural Gas Extraction and Pricing\n\n- Lecture 8: Externalities and Policy Instruments\n\n- Lecture 9: The Benefits and Costs of Environmental Protection\n\n**Section 3: Industrial Ecology**\n\n- Lecture 10: The Changing Landscape for Global Oil Companies\n\n- Lecture 11: Carbon-Neutral Energy Systems \n\n- Lecture 12: Global Energy Disparities\n\n**Section 4: Energy Policy**\n\n- Lecture 13: International Environmental Agreements \n\n- Lecture 14: Energy Efficiency: Puzzle and Policies\n\n- Lecture 15: Unintended Policy Consequences & Course Wrap Up\n\n"},"formats":{"html":{"execute":{"fig-width":7,"fig-height":5,"fig-format":"retina","fig-dpi":96,"df-print":"default","error":false,"eval":true,"cache":null,"freeze":false,"echo":true,"output":true,"warning":true,"include":true,"keep-md":false,"keep-ipynb":false,"ipynb":null,"enabled":null,"daemon":null,"daemon-restart":false,"debug":false,"ipynb-filters":[],"engine":"markdown"},"render":{"keep-tex":false,"keep-yaml":false,"keep-source":false,"keep-hidden":false,"prefer-html":false,"output-divs":true,"output-ext":"html","fig-align":"default","fig-pos":null,"fig-env":null,"code-fold":"none","code-overflow":"scroll","code-link":false,"code-line-numbers":false,"code-tools":false,"tbl-colwidths":"auto","merge-includes":true,"latex-auto-mk":true,"latex-auto-install":true,"latex-clean":true,"latex-max-runs":10,"latex-makeindex":"makeindex","latex-makeindex-opts":[],"latex-tlmgr-opts":[],"latex-input-paths":[],"latex-output-dir":null,"link-external-icon":false,"link-external-newwindow":false,"self-contained-math":false,"format-resources":[]},"pandoc":{"standalone":true,"wrap":"none","default-image-extension":"png","to":"html","output-file":"index.html"},"language":{},"metadata":{"lang":"en","fig-responsive":true,"quarto-version":"1.1.165","bibliography":["references.bib"],"editor":"visual","theme":"cosmo"},"extensions":{"book":{"multiFile":true}}},"pdf":{"execute":{"fig-width":5.5,"fig-height":3.5,"fig-format":"pdf","fig-dpi":300,"df-print":"default","error":false,"eval":true,"cache":null,"freeze":false,"echo":true,"output":true,"warning":true,"include":true,"keep-md":false,"keep-ipynb":false,"ipynb":null,"enabled":null,"daemon":null,"daemon-restart":false,"debug":false,"ipynb-filters":[],"engine":"markdown"},"render":{"keep-tex":false,"keep-yaml":false,"keep-source":false,"keep-hidden":false,"prefer-html":false,"output-divs":true,"output-ext":"pdf","fig-align":"default","fig-pos":null,"fig-env":null,"code-fold":"none","code-overflow":"scroll","code-link":false,"code-line-numbers":false,"code-tools":false,"tbl-colwidths":true,"merge-includes":true,"latex-auto-mk":true,"latex-auto-install":true,"latex-clean":true,"latex-max-runs":10,"latex-makeindex":"makeindex","latex-makeindex-opts":[],"latex-tlmgr-opts":[],"latex-input-paths":[],"latex-output-dir":null,"link-external-icon":false,"link-external-newwindow":false,"self-contained-math":false,"format-resources":[]},"pandoc":{"pdf-engine":"xelatex","standalone":true,"variables":{"graphics":true,"tables":true},"default-image-extension":"pdf","to":"pdf","output-file":"index.pdf"},"language":{},"metadata":{"block-headings":true,"bibliography":["references.bib"],"editor":"visual","documentclass":"scrreprt"},"extensions":{"book":{}}}}}
