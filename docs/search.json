    "text": "Focus on the energy transition has intensified in recent years. How has this increase in global ambition shifted the pace of change in the energy system? And what impact will this have on the fuel mix and emissions?\n\n\n\n\n\nEnergy economics is a broad scientific subject area which includes topics related to supply and use of energy in societies. Due to diversity of issues and methods applied and shared with a number of academic disciplines, energy economics does not present itself as a self contained academic discipline, but it is an applied sub-discipline of economics. From the list of main topics of economics, some relate strongly to energy economics:\n\nEconometrics\nEnvironmental economics\nIndustrial ecology\nMicroeconomics\nMacroeconomics\nResource economics\n\nEnergy economics also draws heavily on results of energy engineering, geology, political sciences, ecology etc. Recent focus of energy economics includes the following issues:\n\nClimate change and climate policy\nSustainability\nEnergy and economic growth\nEconomics of energy infrastructure\nEnvironmental policy\nEnergy policy\nElasticity of supply and demand in energy market\n\nLecture contents:\nSection 1: Energy Economics\n\nLecture 1: Course Introduction & Energy Overview\nLecture 2: Energy: An Economistâ€™s View\nLecture 3: Energy Markets, Prices, and Efficiency\nLecture 4: The Economics of Renewable Energy\nLecture 5: Energy and Economic Growth\nLecture 6: Economic Theory of the Mine\n\nSection 2: Environmental and Natural Resource Economics\n\nLecture 7: Oil and Natural Gas Extraction and Pricing\nLecture 8: Externalities and Policy Instruments\nLecture 9: The Benefits and Costs of Environmental Protection\n\nSection 3: Industrial Ecology\n\nLecture 10: The Changing Landscape for Global Oil Companies\nLecture 11: Carbon-Neutral Energy Systems\nLecture 12: Global Energy Disparities\n\nSection 4: Energy Policy\n\nLecture 13: International Environmental Agreements\nLecture 14: Energy Efficiency: Puzzle and Policies\nLecture 15: Unintended Policy Consequences & Course Wrap Up"
