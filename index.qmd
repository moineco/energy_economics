Energy economics is a broad scientific subject area which includes topics related to supply and use of energy in societies. Due to diversity of issues and methods applied and shared with a number of academic disciplines, energy economics does not present itself as a self contained academic discipline, but it is an applied sub-discipline of economics. From the list of main topics of economics, some relate strongly to energy economics:

-   Econometrics
-   Environmental economics
-   Industrial ecology
-   Microeconomics
-   Macroeconomics
-   Resource economics

Energy economics also draws heavily on results of energy engineering, geology, political sciences, ecology etc. Recent focus of energy economics includes the following issues:

-   Climate change and climate policy
-   Sustainability
-   Energy and economic growth
-   Economics of energy infrastructure
-   Environmental policy
-   Energy policy
-   Elasticity of supply and demand in energy market
